# T1D-DOSIS: Intelligent Therapy Optimization for MDI

**Open-Source Conceptual Feasibility Study for Pen Users with CGM**

*Note: This project is a personal feasibility study and exploratory concept, developed as a proof-of-concept for optimizing MDI therapy. It aims to inspire fellow developers, researchers, and experienced T1D individuals to explore similar ideas. It is **NOT** a ready-to-use system and should never be implemented or relied upon without extensive personal validation, professional medical oversight, and rigorous testing. Misuse could be potentially life-threatening. Proceed only if you have deep expertise in T1D management and software development.*

## What is T1D-DOSIS?

T1D-DOSIS is a **DIY conceptual project** to explore insulin therapy optimization for **Multiple Daily Injections (MDI)** ‚Äì ideal for people using pens or syringes. As a personal feasibility study, it investigates how data-driven tools could enhance MDI for those not using pumps, but it remains in early ideation and is shared primarily as inspiration for the community.

### The Problem

With MDI (pens or syringes) and CGM, the trend direction (rising or falling BG) is usually clear ‚Äì but predicting *how far it goes* and handling external factors like meals or exercise is the real nightmare:

- **Amplitude uncertainty**: Will that -2 mg/dL/min drop bottom out at 80 mg/dL or crash to 50? Even with IOB and ISF knowledge, you only get a rough estimate of the pull ‚Äì not enough for spot-on dosing without risks.
- **Meal mysteries**: You never know the exact insulin-required components ‚Äì not just digestible carbs, but also protein and fat, which contribute delayed, partial insulin needs (e.g., gluconeogenesis from protein, slowed absorption from fat). Variable timing (fatty meals delay peaks by hours, stress alters it) turns ICR calculations into guesswork, causing sneaky post-meal spikes or crashes. Even when digestion is underway and more insulin is surely needed, the dilemma persists: Inject small doses immediately (risking too many shots and potential over-correction) or wait to bundle into fewer injections for similar results (but risking prolonged highs)?
- **Exercise unpredictability**: Depending on type (e.g., HIIT vs. steady cardio) and intensity, it can dramatically swing BG ‚Äì instant drops from heightened insulin sensitivity, delayed hypos hours later, or even spikes from stress hormones. Adjusting doses pre/post-workout is a blind guess without pattern data.
- **Dosing guesswork**: Rising? Inject correction insulin ‚Äì but how many units to avoid rebound? Falling? Swallow glucose tabs/KH ‚Äì but 15g or 10g to not overshoot? It's all approximations, leading to over/under-corrections and instability.
- **Late alarms**: Standard alerts (e.g., at 70 mg/dL) still hit too late; you're scrambling to react, not prevent.
- **No closed-loop for pens**: Systems like AndroidAPS/Loop need a pump ‚Äì leaving MDI users without predictive smarts.
- **Manual tweaks**: Therapy factors (ISF, ICR, basal) demand constant, imprecise fiddling from logs.

Every trend, every bite, every workout becomes a high-stakes gamble. This study explores how layered forecasts could sharpen those edges ‚Äì but remember, it's conceptual only.

### The Solution: Conceptual Components

This feasibility study envisions two components to estimate insulin and carb needs as safely as possible, using layered forecasts ‚Äì from traditional metrics to AI-driven predictions ‚Äì for the leanest, most targeted interventions. These are high-level ideas, not implemented code.

**üì± Conceptual Android App: Intelligent Hypo Early Warning**  
Standard alarm: "70 mg/dL reached" ‚Üí Too late!

Envisioned T1D-DOSIS: "95 mg/dL, but:  
            - 2.5 IU IOB active  
            - Fall rate: -3 mg/dL/min  
            - Your ISF: 1:40 (adjusted for recent drift)  
            - Current BG trajectory  
            ‚Üí Hypo risk building over next 1-2 hours (AI-refined for precision)  
            ‚Üí Eat 15g carbs now ‚Äì minimal dose for quick stabilization"

**üíª Conceptual Desktop Backend: Long-Term Optimization**  
- Analyzes weeks/months of your data for patterns (e.g., sport-induced drops, protein/fat delays)  
- Calculates optimal ISF, ICR, basal rates with safety buffers  
- Accounts for time of day, meals, exercise intensity, and individual factors  
- Provides concrete, prognosis-based dosing recommendations (e.g., "Reduce basal by 1 IU for evening runs to prevent delayed hypos")  

**Example Output:**  
Analysis of the last 4 weeks:  
‚úì ISF varies: Morning 1:35, Evening 1:45 (with 10% safety margin)  
‚úì ICR for pizza (fat/protein mix): 1:10 ‚Üí Recommend 1:8, bolus 50% now + 50% in 2h (to match delayed absorption, minimizing injections while covering the rise)  
‚úì Basal rate: 16 IU ‚Üí 18 IU, but -20% pre-HIIT to counter sensitivity spike  
‚úì Nighttime hypos: Forecast shows 80% risk from residual IOB ‚Äì adjust to 15 IU  
‚úì Post-meal corrections: During digestion, predict need for +2 IU total; suggest waiting 45 min for bundled dose instead of multiple small ones (reduces shots by 50%, same stabilization)  

**Safety First:** All conceptual forecasts prioritize conservative estimates (e.g., overestimating carbs slightly to avoid hypos), with user overrides and clear confidence scores. But this is exploratory ‚Äì **never base real decisions on untested ideas**.

## Who is it for?

### ‚úÖ T1D-DOSIS (as a Study) is for you if you:
- Use **pens or syringes** for treatment (MDI)  
- Use CGM (e.g., Freestyle Libre via Juggluco)  
- Want to explore data-driven therapy optimization conceptually  
- Are willing to try new software (beta-tester mindset)  
- Take personal responsibility for your therapy  
- Are experienced developers/researchers seeking inspiration  

### ‚ùå T1D-DOSIS is ABSOLUTELY NOT for:
- **Pump users** ‚Üí Use AndroidAPS/Loop/OpenAPS (better options!)  
- People without CGM  
- Those expecting certified, ready-to-use solutions  
- **Beginners or anyone without advanced T1D management expertise** (ISF, IOB, etc.) ‚Äì this could be life-threatening if misinterpreted  
- Unprepared individuals hoping for a "quick fix" ‚Äì this is a study, not a product  

### ü§î Why Not Pump + Closed-Loop?

**Closed-loop with a pump is objectively better**, but not feasible or desirable for everyone:  
- üí∞ Cost / no insurance coverage  
- üëï Lifestyle (no visible devices on the body)  
- üèä Sports (swimming, contact sports)  
- üß† Preference for conscious manual control  

‚Üí This study explores making MDI as intelligent as possible ‚Äì purely as a thought experiment and inspiration.

## Architecture

### Component 1: Conceptual Android App (Kotlin)

**Envisioned Real-Time Features:**  
- Receives glucose broadcasts from Juggluco (or xDrip+) as the primary real-time input source  
- **IOB calculation**: Initially sourced from Juggluco for baseline estimates; later refined by fitting individualized curves from accumulated historical data (via backend integration) ‚Äì inspired by xDrip+ algorithms, but customized for personal patterns  
- **ML-based hypo prediction** (beyond standard alarms): Uses all known and estimable parameters (e.g., current fall rate, residual IOB, ISF drifts, meal absorption, recent activity) to forecast future trajectories and suggest the optimal intervention ‚Äì e.g., if BG is falling, preemptively recommend timely carb intake (15g KH) to avoid dipping below 70 mg/dL, minimizing risks like rebounds  
- Displays recommendations from the desktop backend  
- Stores history locally (Room Database) for ongoing data accumulation  

This conceptual design aims to compute the best future prognosis for the most targeted treatment (insulin correction vs. carb intervention), but remains untested ‚Äì for inspiration only.

### Why a Separate App?

T1D-DOSIS is **NOT** a competitor to xDrip+ but a conceptual complement:  

**What xDrip+ excels at (adopted in T1D-DOSIS):**  
- ‚úÖ IOB calculation (proven algorithms)  
- ‚úÖ CGM data processing  
- ‚úÖ Extensive sensor support  

**What T1D-DOSIS conceptually adds:**  
- üÜï ML-based hypo prediction (15-30 min forecast, extensible to hours)  
- üÜï Desktop backend for long-term optimization  
- üÜï Adaptive ISF/ICR calculation from weeks/months of data  
- üÜï Concrete dosing recommendations  

**Alternative Architecture (under consideration):**  
- T1D-DOSIS as an xDrip+ plugin/extension instead of a standalone app  
- To be evaluated in early development  

### Component 2: Conceptual Desktop Backend (Julia)

**Envisioned Long-Term Analysis:**  
- Reads historical data via cloud sync  
- Machine learning for pattern recognition  
- Optimization of therapy factors  
- Generates dosing recommendations  

**Why Julia?**  
- Ideal for scientific computations  
- Fast for complex optimizations  
- Elegant syntax for pharmacokinetic models  

### Component 3: Conceptual Cloud Sync (Google Drive API)

**Data Flow:**  
Android ‚Üí Google Drive (REQUEST.json)  
            ‚Üì  
         Desktop Julia (Analysis)  
            ‚Üì  
Android ‚Üê Google Drive (RESPONSE.json)  

**Latency:** 5-60 minutes (sufficient for long-term optimization)

## Technical Details

### IOB Calculation

**Basis: xDrip+ Algorithm**  
- xDrip+ has excellent, battle-tested IOB calculation  
- T1D-DOSIS uses the same algorithms (open-source GPL-3)  
- No need to reinvent the wheel for proven components  

**Extensions for T1D-DOSIS:**  
- Integration with ISF optimization (adaptive factors)  
- Linking to hypo prediction (ML-based)  
- Long-term IOB pattern analysis in the Julia backend  

### ISF Optimization

**Multi-Factorial:**  
- Time of day (circadian rhythm)  
- Weekday (work vs. weekend)  
- Activity level  
- Hormonal cycles, stress, illness  

**Machine Learning Approach:**  
- Time-series analysis over weeks/months  
- Pattern and anomaly detection  
- Adaptive factor adjustments  

### Hypo Prediction

**MDI-Specific:**  
- **Layered Approach**: Start with traditional metrics (ISF, IOB, current BG) for baseline calculations ‚Äì e.g., rough multi-hour projections like "tight spot in 2 hours" based on fall rate and residual insulin pull.  
- **Advanced Refinements**: Incorporate drifts in insulin sensitivity (e.g., circadian variations or long-term trends from data) to fine-tune estimates, reducing uncertainty in amplitude and timing.  
- **AI-Enhanced Methods**: Leverage machine learning (e.g., time-series models in Julia) for the best possible forecasts ‚Äì integrating meal absorption, exercise effects, and personal patterns to enable the sparsest (minimal intervention), most targeted (precise dosing), and fastest (preemptive) responses.  
- Extended horizons (15 min to hours), conservative thresholds (no pump safety net), and reduced false alarms via these layers.

## Disclaimer & Important Notes

### Status: Personal DIY Feasibility Study

T1D-DOSIS is a **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) feasibility study** by and for people with T1D ‚Äì a personal exploration to test ideas, not a deployable tool:  
- ‚ùå Not a certified medical device (CE/FDA)  
- ‚ùå No clinical studies conducted  
- ‚ùå Not validated by medical professionals  
- ‚ùå No professional support  
- ‚ùå **Potentially life-threatening if any ideas are applied without expert validation** ‚Äì this is conceptual inspiration only  

**Similar to:** OpenAPS, AndroidAPS, Loop ‚Äì established DIY systems that work and are used worldwide, but never medically certified. However, T1D-DOSIS is far earlier: a study to spark ideas, not to build upon directly.

### Personal Responsibility

**You are responsible for:**  
- Deciding to build/use this system  
- Understanding and validating all algorithms  
- All therapeutic decisions  
- Collaborating with your diabetes care team  
- Recognizing that even conceptual errors could lead to harm if misinterpreted  

**T1D-DOSIS provides recommendations; YOU make decisions.** But as a study, even those are unproven ‚Äì treat as hypotheses.

### Liability Disclaimer

The author assumes **no liability** for:  
- Software or algorithm errors  
- Incorrect dosing recommendations  
- Medical complications  
- Any damages  
- **Misuse of ideas leading to life-threatening situations**  

**Use at your own risk ‚Äì and only if you fully grasp the dangers.**

### Medical Note

T1D-DOSIS is **not a substitute** for:  
- Professional medical advice  
- Regular endocrinologist visits  
- Emergency protocols for hypo/hyper  
- Common sense  

**For medical questions:** Always consult your doctor. Do not experiment based on this study without their guidance.

### Certification & Regulatory Approval

**Reality:** T1D-DOSIS will likely **never** receive regulatory approval.  

**Why?**  
- Approval takes years and costs millions  
- DIY projects can't afford this effort  
- Similar systems (OpenAPS, AndroidAPS, Loop) are also uncertified  

**But:** These systems work for experienced users ‚Äì at their own risk. T1D-DOSIS is not there yet; it's a study to inspire safer paths.
